A new post of our interview series [“Meeting the stars of the R-universe”](/tags/r-universe-stars/). We aim to introduce the teams and people behind the development of software and packages many of us use and which are available through the R-Universe. We want to highlight and explore different teams and projects around the world, the work they do, their processes and users. Our third stop is __Norway__ to talk with __Athanasia Monika Mowinckel__. Be sure to watch the [video](/blog/2023/03/30/r-universe-stars-3-en/#video-of-the-interview) at the end with excerpts from the interview.
