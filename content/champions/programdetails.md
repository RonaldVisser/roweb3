## Program goals

After the inaugural year of the _rOpenSci Champions Program_ we open the second call!!

The program aims to support R developers, from around the world, and who identify themselves as members of a group that is systematically excluded from the open software community to:

* Gain the skills to develop their own R package or;
* Gain confidence in submitting an R package for peer review or become a reviewer.
* Learn how to lead a workshop or other event about package development or software peer review -  or another rOpenSci activity - in their local community.
* Connect with a supportive network of peers and mentors within the R ecosystem.
* Provide feedback to help rOpenSci to continue to host relevant, welcoming activities for R developers.
* Gain transferable skills and experiences that are sought after for careers in open source software.

We are looking six to nine Champions for this second group. We expect to co-create the rOpenSci Champion program with the selected applicants and influence future editions with their experience and feedback.

We look forward to receiving many applications and are committed to directing non-selected applicants towards other ways in which they can contribute to rOpenSci.

## Program expectations

{{< figure src = "/images/volunteer/peep6.png" width = "300" alt = "A person with his dog working on a notebook." class = "pull-left" >}}

Champions are expected to _complete training and attend meetings with their mentors and cohorts_. After training, Champions will develop their own project. Projects may involve building a new package or going through the peer review process as an author or a reviewer.

Champions will also choose and perform several activities, such as running recruitment activities, giving presentations, writing blog posts, and organizing peer groups in their communities.

It is expected that Champions will promote participation in peer review and contribution to rOpenSci open source software, infrastructure, and documentation. They will also gather feedback on where rOpenSci’s current programming might be improved to meet the needs of all who wish to participate.

The estimated time commitment for each Champion is, on average, __16 hours per month__  (including trainings, cohort events, mentoring meetings, package development or review process, and preparing for and hosting events). The total time commitment for each Champion will vary based on the path and activities they choose to do during the program.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I don't have my own package to work on, can I apply with other people's package?

If the package already exists, the possible project is to send it for review.  In that case the requirements are:
1) Have written permission (can be an email) from the authors or maintainers of the package.
2) Commit to maintain the package for two years.

### Does the program have a cost for participants?

No, the program it is free.  The champions will get a small stipend for being part of the program.

### Can we apply it as a team?

No in this call.  You can pick some of the member of the team and they can apply with your project. 
Please note that if the person has not contributed to the package previously, please accompany the application with a note that he/she is part of the team and has permission from the authors and maintainers to work on the package.

### What does it mean to belong to a historically and systematically excluded group?

To belong to a historically and systematically excluded group means being part of a community or identity that has faced long-standing patterns of marginalization, discrimination, and disadvantage. It encompasses groups that have been historically oppressed, discriminated against, or denied equal opportunities based on various factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, socioeconomic status, geographic location, or any combination thereof.

### Can I propose more than one package?

The time involved in the program only allows you to work on one package. To help you decide which one to propose in the application, check that the package is in [rOpenSci peer-review scope](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html?q=scope#aims-and-scope) or [rOpenSci stat peer review scope](https://ropensci.org/stat-software-review/).

### Can I apply for a project type and then change it?

No. We seek to have a balance in the number of each type of project and we assign mentors also according to the type of project.    

### What does a solid idea mean for a package? What is the appropriate scope? 

A solid idea refers to a well-conceived concept for the package that you can work on inmeadiately. We don't expect project to explore ideas of packages and we don't provide ideas for new packages. 

This are [rOpenSci Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html?q=scope#aims-and-scope) and [Stats Review](https://ropensci.org/stat-software-review/) scopes for packages. We expect projects related with research software. 

### I don't have much experience programming in R, can I apply?

The program is aimed at people who already have experience in R. We expect you to know how to work with projects, control structures and how to write functions.  If you already have experience developing packages (either their own or contributing to other people's packages) all the better. We also expect you to have basic knowledge of git and GitHub. 

### I have a package that is under review on CRAN, which option should I choose?

If you want to work on that package during the program then the option would be to Submit your package to the peer review process, even though we advise to go through our review first and then submit the package to CRAN.
